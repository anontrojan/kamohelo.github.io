                <p>Pretty cool design right? well it's just the beginning,
                    actually i almost quit making this page, the reason being is that
                    i didn't know where to start because i was afraid of the outcome
                    of my actions but then what wtf, let me give you a taste my confession.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know it is somehow ackward or a little bit too much,and i believe this is the first
                    and the last time doing this kind of a thing. Before i proceed to the reason why
                    i created this website, allow me to say this is not a proposal or something close to that,
                    and i know you've already told me what you would say if i confess, but i'm not looking for any
                    answers at the moment, NO NEED TO ANSWER ME AFTER READING THIS!!!!!. I ALREADY KNOW IT..:)
                    i'm just removing weight inside my chest and hoping that it will make my regrets to go away.
                    Logically you must be saying {"wtf is wrong with him, i'm her friend, what is he thinking?"}, 
                    maybe i'm crasy who knows? Let me just say for the last 3 weeks re le skolong i evolved and 
                    suddenly i somehow developed feelings for you, wait! what? Yeah i just said it, i have feelings for you,
                    don't know what happened but yeah it's true. You know what i think i just said too much, let me bounce..
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the way, this website ke e entse ka <i>html & css</i>, those animations you see 
                    it's all coding since you like art i thought i should use them, you can even create a website
                    for your poems for people to read.. With that being said, that's the end.
